# Quick Testing Guide - DNA Match Feature

## 🧬 Example DNA Samples Testing

This guide shows you exactly how to test the DNA matching feature with the provided sample files.

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

1. Two user accounts created in your Esano platform:
   - **User 1:** john@example.com (Parent)
   - **User 2:** jane@example.com (Child - looking for matches)

2. Files ready:
   - ✅ `user1-parent.txt` (516 SNPs)
   - ✅ `user2-child.txt` (516 SNPs)

---

## 🎯 Test Scenario: Parent-Child Match

### Step 1: Upload Parent's DNA (Existing User)

1. **Login as User 1** (john@example.com)
2. Navigate to: **Dashboard → DNA Analysis**
3. Click **"Upload DNA File"**
4. Select: `user1-parent.txt`
5. Click **"Upload"**
6. ✅ **Success Message:** "DNA file uploaded successfully"

**What Happens:**
- DNA data stored in Firestore under User 1's profile
- 516 SNPs parsed and saved
- Ready for matching against future uploads

---

### Step 2: Upload Child's DNA and Find Match (New User)

1. **Logout from User 1**
2. **Login as User 2** (jane@example.com)
3. Navigate to: **Dashboard → DNA Analysis**
4. Click **"Upload DNA File"**
5. Select: `user2-child.txt`
6. Click **"Upload"**
7. ✅ **Success Message:** "DNA file uploaded successfully"
8. Click **"Find DNA Matches"** button

**Expected Result:**
```
🎉 Match Found!

```

### Key Indicators:

1. **High IBS2 Count:** ~300/500 SNPs match perfectly (60%)
2. **Low IBS0 Count:** Only ~50/500 have no shared alleles (10%)
3. **Kinship ~0.25:** Falls in parent-child range (0.177-0.354)
4. **Multiple IBD Segments:** Long stretches of matching DNA

## 🧪 Testing Different Scenarios

### Scenario A: No Existing Matches

**Setup:**
- User 2 uploads DNA first (no existing DNA in system)

**Expected Result:**
```
No DNA matches found

Your DNA has been saved. As more users upload their DNA,
you'll be notified of any matches!

[View My DNA Info]
```

---

### Scenario B: Multiple Matches

**Setup:**
- Upload 3 different user DNAs with varying relationships
- User 4 uploads and matches multiple users

**Expected Result:**
```
3 DNA Matches Found!

1. Parent-child - 90% confidence - 3400 cM
2. Sibling - 85% confidence - 2600 cM
3. First cousin - 75% confidence - 850 cM
```

---

### Scenario C: Insufficient DNA Data

**Setup:**
- Upload a file with only 100 SNPs (below 500 minimum)

**Expected Result:**
```
❌ Error: Insufficient SNP Markers

Found: 100 SNPs
Required: 500+ SNPs for accurate matching

Please upload a valid DNA test file from:
- 23andMe
- AncestryDNA
- MyHeritage
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem 1: Upload Fails

**Symptoms:**
```
❌ Error: Failed to upload DNA file
```

**Solutions:**
1. Check file size < 10 MB
2. Verify file format (.txt)
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Try refreshing page

---

### Problem 2: No Matches Despite Uploaded DNA

**Symptoms:**
- Both files uploaded successfully
- "Find Matches" returns 0 results

**Solutions:**
1. ✅ Verify files uploaded to **different user accounts**
2. ✅ Check both files have 500+ SNPs
3. ✅ Verify positions overlap (same chromosome-position format)
4. ✅ Check console logs for matching process

---

### Problem 3: Match Confidence Too Low

**Symptoms:**
```
Match Found: Distant relatives (4th-6th cousins)
Confidence: 45%
```

**Solutions:**
1. Check if files have enough overlapping positions
2. Verify kinship coefficient value
3. May be a true distant relationship
4. Review IBS distribution metrics

## 📧 Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check browser console (F12)
2. Review server logs
3. Verify Firebase rules allow DNA data access

**Common Console Commands:**
```javascript
// Check if DNA data saved
firebase.firestore().collection('users').doc('userId').get()
  .then(doc => console.log('DNA Data:', doc.data().dnaData))

// Check DNA data collection
firebase.firestore().collection('dna_data')
  .where('userId', '==', 'userId').get()
  .then(snap => snap.docs.map(d => d.data()))
```

✅ **Testing Complete!** Your DNA matching feature is working correctly if:
- Both files upload successfully
- Match is detected with correct relationship
- Confidence score is reasonable (85-95%)
- Metrics match expected values

🎉 **Congratulations!** You now have a working DNA matching system!
