## Defense Script

**Show FamilyHeadManager:**
> "Here's the Main Family Head manager. Users can designate one person as the overall patriarch or matriarch. The system ensures only one main head exists, shows a crown icon, and uses gold highlighting. There's a confirmation dialog when changing heads to prevent accidents."

**Show GenerationManager:**
> "Each generation can have a sub-head. I built this manager where users create generations, name them meaningfully like 'Grandparents,' and select a representative. The system automatically groups members by generation number and displays the sub-head with a star icon."

**Show SubfamilyManager:**
> "For extended families, users can create subfamilies—like 'The Mugisha Branch.' Each subfamily has a head, members, and optional description. This lets large families organize into smaller manageable units while maintaining the overall structure."

**Visual Indicators:**
> "I use a clear icon system: Crown for main head, Star for generation sub-heads, House for subfamily heads. Each has distinct colors—gold for main head, blue for generation sub-heads, green for subfamily heads."
